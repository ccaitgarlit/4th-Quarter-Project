                <h3> <b>Ancient Astronomy</b> </h3>
				<p>
			       Our perceptions of the Solar System and space have evolved over time. 
			       For thousands of years, people have looked to the heavens. 
			       They studied the movement of the stars as well as the changes in the Sun and Moon. 
			       Star maps were created using what was known about the positions of stars, eclipses, and Moon phases. 
			       This data was used to create calendars and measure time. 
			       It was extremely beneficial for determining when to plant crops or for navigating.
